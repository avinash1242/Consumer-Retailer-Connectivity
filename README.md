# Consumer-Retailer-Connectivity
College Project - Data Science

The code when run takes a data input with a list of consumer trasactions. These are then processed to form and identify patterns with minimum support and confidence. If you do not know what that means, search it on the internet, just the way you got to my project and God bless you.

The user can then view the results of the patter analysis in "Telegram", a social app available on all mobile platforms. A bot by name "justdoitOBNR" is programmed to get this specific job done. Just head over to the search space in the application and search with the bot name. Get ready to have a productive and interactive conversation. By the time you say "hi", the bot already knows you. If you still couldn't find the bot, this might help you - https://telegram.me/justdoitOBNRbot.

The programs are divided into various sections for easier debugging and handling. The project flow chart and its understanding depiction will make you better understand the working of the entire thing. Do give it a look before you head on to compilation.

In order to run the whole program, one need to run just the "MasterControl.py" which inturn runs all the other programs in a timely sequence. Be sure to run the "MasterControl.py" before you message the bot.
